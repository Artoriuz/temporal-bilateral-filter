# Temporal Bilateral Filter

## Overview
The script receives an array containing multiple consecutive frames, and applies a temporal bilateral filter to the central frame. This is merely a prototype to test the idea.

## Example
The frames used to generate the image below can be found under `/images`. Since there are 5 frames, `frame_0002` is the central frame.
